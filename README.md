## *Introduction*
I will be doing a web interface for a bicycle counter project. The main goal is to collect data from files, which are generated by the counter itself and process those informations to a database. Then create a web platform to display the daily, monthly, etc. averages and view them in a map using Google's API.


## *Main Parts*
This full-stack project will consist of 3 part:
- [x] **Python code** —> *to read data from files*
- [ ] **Database** -> *to store data*
- [ ] **Front-End** —> *to show the gathered data*


## *What does the python code do?*
The python code is consist of 3 python files:
- [x] **main.py** —> where the program runs
- [x] **file.py** -> where the file reading happens
- [x] **database.py** -> where the database communication happens


In both **'file_OOP.py', 'database.py'** files are *a class and functions*, which are used in the **'main.py'**.
In **'file_OOP.py'** file there's *a class* called **'File'** and *two functions* called **'readDirectory()', moveFile()'**. In it is *a getter, setter and deleter*, also a *'read_file'* function, which reads the given 

## *How does the database look like?*
