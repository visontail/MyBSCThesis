## *Project Overview*

The objective of this project is to develop a web interface for the representation of bicycle counter data. The primary aim is to gather data generated by the bicycle counter, process it, and store it in a database. Subsequently, a web platform will be created to present daily, monthly, and other averages. The collected data will also be visualized on a map utilizing the Google Maps API.

The creation of this interface serves the *purpose* of gaining insights into the information derived from the measured bicycle counter data.
