# MyBSCThesis

## Basics
I will be doing a web interface for a bicycle counter project. The main goal is to collect data from files, which are generated by the counter itself and process those informations to a database. Then create a web platform to display the daily, monthly, etc. averages and view them in a map using Google's API.

## Main Parts
This full-stack development project will consist of 3 part:
<ul>
    <li> python code, </li>
    <li> database, </li>
    <li> webpage. </li>

</ul>



## *What the code does?*
<ul>
    <li> ( 1 ) - reads the given directory & lists out .xtx file's names in a list </li>
    <li> ( 2 ) - main -> for loop </li>
</ul>
