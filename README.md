## *Description*

The **full-stack** application focuses on sorting, storing, and visualizing traffic data generated by a bicycle counter. Utilizing the Google Maps API, the application displays counter stations on a map.

This project was developed as part of my **BSc thesis** to gain insights from the measured bicycle counter data.
